        <h3 className="history">Our History</h3>
        <p className="history-copy">
          SpeakOut (501c3) was founded in 1990 as part of the Institute for Social and Cultural Change, a non-profit organization that also included the progressive publishing house South End Press and Z Magazine. Initially, SpeakOut served as a platform to showcase authors from South End Press, including renowned intellectuals such as Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Elizabeth Martinez, and Winona LaDuke.<br/><br/>

          The organization was founded by Jean Caiani, who brought with her experience in organizing speaking tours for former CIA agent and whistleblower Philip Agee, as well as her years of service with the United Farm Workers Union, where she coordinated tours for Cesar Chavez. SpeakOut quickly became a go-to resource for those seeking progressive speakers and artists to engage with on campuses and beyond.

          In the years since its founding, SpeakOut has grown its roster to include dozens of speakers, scholars, performing and visual artists, exhibits, and films, all dedicated to educating, inspiring, and empowering young people and others to become actively engaged in society and to work towards social justice. Among its speakers and artists are some of the most prominent and influential figures in their fields, ensuring that SpeakOut is always at the forefront of progressive discourse.<br/><br/>
    
          In addition to organizing hundreds of lectures and performances each year, SpeakOut has also expanded its programming and impact through the Education Institution, which offers virtual events, e-courses, the annual Summer Institute, films and film programs, and an online store and resources. By leveraging innovative programming and our incredible network, SpeakOut is able to bring its mission of promoting social justice and progressive change to an ever-widening audience.
